# SnakeGame

## Overview

This is the simple snake game that you are probably familiar with. Move the snake around the screen, collect pellets, and don't run into other parts of the snake
or the edges of the screen.

The goal of this project is for me to learn some simple game development with Java and libGDX. I'll be keeping the issues page up to date with what I'm working on,
so check that out if you're interested.

## Running the game

You will need Java 8+ and Gradle to build the project.

Clone the repo locally and from the top level directory, run
```
./gradlew desktop:run
```

The game can also be run in a web browser by running
```
./gradlew html:superDev
```
